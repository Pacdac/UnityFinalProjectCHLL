The master branch is the desktop game without any VR implementation. It lacks some features such as the pause menu (as it was directly implemented in the VR version of the game).
The XRTest branch is the VR game.
You should launch the game with XRMenu.

All the following assets must be installed in order for the game to work as intended (otherwise it would still be plaayable but some props/assets won't be present)
It hasn't been pushed to Git to avoid making a too large repository.
